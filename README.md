# Project-1-Recommender
My first ML project (data analysis + recommender system)
 Week 1 Day 1 Progress 
 - Revised Python basics
 - Created a CSV analysis script
 - Uploaded first code to GitHub
  
 📅 Day 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (Short)

- Loaded the dataset and checked basic structure (rows, columns, datatypes)
- Analyzed missing values and removed/filled:
  - Dropped `homepage` (64% missing)
  - Filled `tagline` and `keywords` with “No tagline” / “unknown”
  - Dropped rows with very small missing values in genres/overview/runtime
- Removed duplicate rows
- Explored key features:
  - Most common genres
  - Rating distribution
  - Popularity of movies
- Created insights to understand the dataset for the recommender system
- Updated and uploaded `EDA_Day2.ipynb` to GitHub
